Tenable REST API Challenge
==========================

Here we have my implementation of a Node.js REST api
challenge offered by Tenable Network Security.

The Challenge (verbatim, apologies if there is copyright infringement =])
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using Node (and only Node) create a web service with a REST API with 
routes that:
  1) Allow a user to login
  2) Allow a user to logout

Building on the previous question, use Node (and only Node) to create a REST 
compliant API with routes that allow an authenticated user to:
  1) Retrieve server configurations as JSON data (using the below as a sample)
  2) Create configurations
  3) Delete configurations
  4) Modify configurations

Building on the previous question, use Node (and only Node) to modify your
REST compliant API routes to support:
  1) Sorting by name, hostname, port, or username
  2) Pagination (you will need to randomize and expand the confgiurations for this)
